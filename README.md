# that-weather-dashboard
This project seeks to deliver a simple weather dashboard that leverages the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities.
When users search for a city, they are presented with a 5 day weather forecast and the UI displays pertinent weather information for that city, including a UV index with a color indicator informing the user whether conditions are favorable, moderate or severe. 

The city is then added to the search history, appearing within the last searched city section on the UI. 


## User Story
As a traveler, I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that I can plan for a trip accordingly.
