# that-weather-dashboard
This project seeks to deliver a simple weather dashboard that leverages the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities.
When users search for a city, they are presented with a 5 day weather forecast and the UI displays pertinent weather information for that city, including a UV index with a color indicator informing the user whether conditions are favorable, moderate or severe. 

The city is then added to the search history, allowing the user to revist past searches.

## User Story
As a traveler, I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that I can plan for a trip accordingly.
